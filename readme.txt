Provide custom pages for your blog through automatically mapped theme templates. Great for custom HTML and static content!

== Description ==
Ever faced the situation where you want to create a page on your blog that can not accidentally be deleted or edited through the dashboard? Or perhaps you have some custom HTML that the WordPress editor keeps on modifying wrongly. There are hacks you can do to fix things like these, but there has to be a more elegant solution.

Theme Pages uses a custom post type that swaps the default editor for an automatically assigned page template within a parent or child theme. The pages you create retain the same abilities of other post types, but the actual content can be written in pure HTML unmodifiable by WordPress.

Benefits include:

- Hard coded HTML allows you to better customize pages.
- Easily transported, just copy the theme files!
- Does not interfere with other plugins or features in WordPress.

A good example could be creating a contact us page, you will likely never change the content, but a user accidentally editing it could break the functionality. Using this plug-in you could provide it instead with the theme.

== Installation ==
Simply install and activate, there are no set-up requirements needed to get started. Once activated use the Theme Pages menu item to assign and customize available pages.

To create a new page. First go to the Theme Pages menu item in your dashboard (make sure to activate the plug-in first). Create a theme page giving it a name, and make sure it is published or scheduled. Once you have done that, the developers section will tell you where to create a new page template. If you are new to page templates, then check out the Page Templates article over at WordPress.org codex.
